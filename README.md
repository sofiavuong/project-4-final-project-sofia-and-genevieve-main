# Project 4: Final Project

For this project, you will implement the program that you proposed as a final project in Project 3. This project will be completed with your previous project partner.

Your program will need to meet the following requirements:

* Some form of user input (can be a file, an image, the user typing or clicking, etc.).
* Some form of output (a new file, a displayed image, an interactive UI, printed output, a plot, etc.).
* Perform some kind of logic beyond input and output
* Use a list, a dictionary, and/or loop somewhere
* Follow the structure and style guidelines from the book and previous projects. Functions should be well-used to divide the code up logically â€“ if you have a function/method that is more than 10-20 lines of code, think about how you might simplify it. You must also have docstrings for each function you write and a docstring at the top of each file explaining what the file is for. **This is especially important since there is no template for this project!**
* Your program must execute correctly, and generate different results if given different input (or each time it's run, if randomness is involved).
* You must include unit tests for at least two of your functions in a separate testing module.

## Deliverables
**A. A working implementation of your program.** I have not given you any starter code. You should figure out a reasonable structure for your program and sync all of your files in this repository.

I should be able to run your program and your tests without ANY modifications to your code. How you structure your code and files is up to you, so long as you follow the guidelines from above, e.g. you must have a separate testing module with your unit tests.

**B. A first detailed document, called "Instructions" (.doc or .pdf) with instructions on how to run your program with screenshots to illustrate/demonstrate its functionality.** I will run your program to grade it, and I cannot give credit if I cannot figure out how to run it and don't see any evidence of it working in your instructions. If you like, you MAY make a video demonstrating your program instead of this document, but please discuss this with me first to ensure that it is of sufficient clarity and detail.

**C. A second document, called "Writeup" (.doc or .pdf) that answers the following questions:**

1. How do you think your project went?  Did you implement everything you planned to? If not, how did you adjust?
2. Contribution Statement: How did each partner contribute to the final product?
3. What was one part that was surprisingly difficult, and why? How did you overcome this?
4. What was one part that was surprisingly easy, and why?
5. What are you most proud of in your final project?
6. What is one thing that you learned while doing this project?
7. Optional: What is one feature that you would like to add if given more time?

**D.** **Each team must check in with me at least one time in office hours or via an alternative arrangement to get feedback before the final submission of the project. Simply having this check-in will be worth 5% of your project grade!**
